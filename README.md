# Spotify Room Controller
 
Spotify Room Controller is a web application that allows users to create and join rooms to collaboratively control Spotify playback. Users can play, pause, skip, and vote to skip songs, making it a great tool for parties, study groups, or any shared listening experience.

## Features

- Create Rooms: Set up a new room with customizable settings like the number of votes required to skip a song and whether guests have control over playback.
- Join Rooms: Join existing rooms to listen to music together and participate in playback control.
- Control Playback: Play, pause, and skip tracks directly from the app.
Collaborative Experience: Vote to skip songs and manage playback settings with other room members.
- Spotify Integration: Uses Spotify's API to authenticate users and control playback.

## Tools and Technologies
